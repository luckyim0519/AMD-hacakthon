42,"AMD's eight-core Ryzen 7 2700X shines for workstation apps and multitasking, and gamers who pair it with a high-end video card should get better 1080p gaming than with first-gen Ryzen. That's a winning combo.",
43,"With incremental improvements to multi-threaded performance, thermal management, and overclocking, the Ryzen Threadripper 2950X makes AMD's flagship consumer CPU lineup even better than it was before.",
44,"At $799, AMD's 12-core Threadripper chip skips along ahead of Intel's competing $999 Core i9 on core-happy computing tasks, while costing a couple of hundred bucks less. Just factor in the high cost of motherboards and cooling into your build budget.
",
45,"AMD's 16-core Threadripper 1950X is no-brainer for serious content creators and uncompromising multi-taskers. It also handled our test game titles better than Intel's competing Core i9. Just know that compatible X399 motherboards are pricey, at least at launch. And cooling may be an issue if you plan on overclocking.
",
46,"AMD's entry-level Ryzen 3 1200 CPU is a good pick for gaming or general computing, edging out Intel's pricier Core i3. But if performance is key to you, the higher-clocked Ryzen 3 1300X is a better buy for $20 more.",
47,"The $129 Ryzen 3 is a fine fit for gamers, with four cores near the price of a dual-core Intel Core i3. For editing video or other CPU-intensive tasks, though, AMD's Ryzen 5 chips are tough to ignore, starting at just $30 more.",
48,AMD's entry-level Ryzen 5 delivers lots of threads for $169 and fares well in many tests against Intel Core i3 and i5 alternatives. But overclockers and gamers with powerful video cards should step up the Ryzen 5 line.,
