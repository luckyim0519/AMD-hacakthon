6,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7900 has some of the best power efficiency and performance per watt among desktop CPUs. With its included cooler, it's a capable and low-power 12-core option, all for a similar price to the higher-end 7900X.",
7,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7900X is essentially a cut-back 7950X at a lower price. For heavy-threaded workloads (but not ""32 threads"" heavy), the 7900X delivers—but AMD's 7900 performs just about as well for even less.",
8,"With ho-hum CPU performance for the money, AMD's gaming-minded Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a tough sell as a mainstream CPU, given that its strengths will benefit only a small sliver of gamers.",
9,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X3D is a speedy AM5 processor, but its added cache doesn't do enough to justify its effective price premium. Current Core i9 chips, and AMD's own 7950X, tamp down its relative value.",
10,"AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 is a respectable processor with a worthy stock cooler and fast performance, especially in games, but it can't quite topple the Intel Core i5-13600K, which matches it in price.",
11,"AMD's Zen 4-based Ryzen 7 7700X is a no-doubt-speedy CPU, but it's outshined by Intel's 12th Gen Core i7-12700K. It needs a price cut to stand out, especially with a 16-core ""Raptor Lake"" Core i7 coming.",
12,"The 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X delivers exceptional performance that blows previous AMD consumer chips out of the water and even outpaces Intel's top competing ""Alder Lake"" efforts.",
13,"AMD's Ryzen 5 4500 is a slightly retro CPU with one or two strikes against it due to its aging ""Zen 2"" architecture, but it nevertheless offers solid performance for budget buyers who own a graphics card.",
14,"AMD's Ryzen 5 5500 offers decent performance for non-gaming tasks, but it trails slightly costlier AMD and Intel CPUs in our benchmarks, making it a second-tier pick.",

20,"AMD's cheaper Ryzen 3 3300X remains a stellar value among gaming CPUs, but the Ryzen 5 5600X is enough of a brute at its midrange price to make it the best pure gaming CPU of the year.",
21,The 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X is the perfect pick for AMD-loyal content creators who needs tons of multithreaded muscle in a reasonably priced CPU on a mainstream platform.,
22,"With the help of new ""Zen 3"" architecture, AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X delivers relentless gaming and content-creation muscle that Intel's like-priced 10th Generation CPUs will struggle to match.",
23,"Seeking the pinnacle of speed and value in the desktop CPU market around $500? AMD's Zen 3-based Ryzen 9 5900X is the new pace-setter, topping Intel's Core i9-10900K on all the fronts that matter.",
24,"It's undeniably a muscle chip, but on price, content-creation power, and gaming results, AMD's Ryzen 7 3800XT can't quite escape the shadow of the too-good, too-cheap Ryzen 7 3700X.",
25,"While AMD's Ryzen 5 3600XT isn't the peak value choice for frame-rate-obsessed 1080p gamers, 4K players and mid-budget content creators will be hard-pressed to find a better-balanced CPU for the price.",
26,"If you're a content creator who hasn't already dabbled with AMD's killer Zen 2 Ryzen CPUs, the Ryzen 3900XT, a tune-up of the 12-core 3900X, is worth a second glance in its price lane.",
27,"Offering solid performance (and decent on-chip graphics silicon) right out of the box, AMD's Athlon 3000G is a worthwhile AM4-socket processor solution for anyone who can't quite afford a Ryzen 3 or Core i3.",
28,"The Ryzen 3 3100 is a stellar CPU for budget gamers and content creators who have a dedicated video card, bringing major multi-threaded pep to the $99 price point. Even so, many shoppers will be better off springing another Jackson for AMD's great Ryzen 3 3300X instead.",

42,"AMD's eight-core Ryzen 7 2700X shines for workstation apps and multitasking, and gamers who pair it with a high-end video card should get better 1080p gaming than with first-gen Ryzen. That's a winning combo.",
43,"With incremental improvements to multi-threaded performance, thermal management, and overclocking, the Ryzen Threadripper 2950X makes AMD's flagship consumer CPU lineup even better than it was before.",
44,"At $799, AMD's 12-core Threadripper chip skips along ahead of Intel's competing $999 Core i9 on core-happy computing tasks, while costing a couple of hundred bucks less. Just factor in the high cost of motherboards and cooling into your build budget.
",
45,"AMD's 16-core Threadripper 1950X is no-brainer for serious content creators and uncompromising multi-taskers. It also handled our test game titles better than Intel's competing Core i9. Just know that compatible X399 motherboards are pricey, at least at launch. And cooling may be an issue if you plan on overclocking.
",
46,"AMD's entry-level Ryzen 3 1200 CPU is a good pick for gaming or general computing, edging out Intel's pricier Core i3. But if performance is key to you, the higher-clocked Ryzen 3 1300X is a better buy for $20 more.",
47,"The $129 Ryzen 3 is a fine fit for gamers, with four cores near the price of a dual-core Intel Core i3. For editing video or other CPU-intensive tasks, though, AMD's Ryzen 5 chips are tough to ignore, starting at just $30 more.",
48,AMD's entry-level Ryzen 5 delivers lots of threads for $169 and fares well in many tests against Intel Core i3 and i5 alternatives. But overclockers and gamers with powerful video cards should step up the Ryzen 5 line.,
49,"At just $219 with six cores and 12 threads, AMD's Ryzen 5 1600 could be a cash-strapped content creator's dream chip. Just don't expect to do serious overclocking without investing in a better cooler.",
