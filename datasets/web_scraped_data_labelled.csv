0,"AMD's Ryzen 7 8700G is an excellent single-chip gaming solution, especially for small PCs that can't house a graphics card, but it just can't beat a conventional CPU and GPU combination on price/performance.",negative
1,AMD's 32-core Ryzen Threadripper 7970X delivers superior value for professional users who need supercharged multi-threaded performance and the platform's high lane counts.,positive
2,"AMD's 64-core Ryzen Threadripper 7980X drives leading multi-threaded performance with superb efficiency. It's pricey and runs hot, but pro content creators and demanding users using optimized software will thrill to its power, and all those cores and threads.",positive
3,"AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is simply beat out in many tests by lower-priced competition, making this a difficult processor to recommend at current pricing.",negative
4,"AMD's Micro Center-exclusive Ryzen 5 5600X3D could have been a competitive processor for PC gaming were it released much sooner, but today it's outshined by competing AMD and Intel chips as much as two years old.",negative
5,"If gameplay on a budget is your main PC use, AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 is a reasonable and affordable CPU choice. With minimal cooling required, it will handle mainstream computing and gaming needs.",positive
6,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7900 has some of the best power efficiency and performance per watt among desktop CPUs. With its included cooler, it's a capable and low-power 12-core option, all for a similar price to the higher-end 7900X.",positive
7,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7900X is essentially a cut-back 7950X at a lower price. For heavy-threaded workloads (but not ""32 threads"" heavy), the 7900X deliversâ€”but AMD's 7900 performs just about as well for even less.",negative
8,"With ho-hum CPU performance for the money, AMD's gaming-minded Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a tough sell as a mainstream CPU, given that its strengths will benefit only a small sliver of gamers.",negative
9,"AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X3D is a speedy AM5 processor, but its added cache doesn't do enough to justify its effective price premium. Current Core i9 chips, and AMD's own 7950X, tamp down its relative value.",negative
10,"AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 is a respectable processor with a worthy stock cooler and fast performance, especially in games, but it can't quite topple the Intel Core i5-13600K, which matches it in price.",negative
11,"AMD's Zen 4-based Ryzen 7 7700X is a no-doubt-speedy CPU, but it's outshined by Intel's 12th Gen Core i7-12700K. It needs a price cut to stand out, especially with a 16-core ""Raptor Lake"" Core i7 coming.",negative
12,"The 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X delivers exceptional performance that blows previous AMD consumer chips out of the water and even outpaces Intel's top competing ""Alder Lake"" efforts.",positive
13,"AMD's Ryzen 5 4500 is a slightly retro CPU with one or two strikes against it due to its aging ""Zen 2"" architecture, but it nevertheless offers solid performance for budget buyers who own a graphics card.",positive
14,"AMD's Ryzen 5 5500 offers decent performance for non-gaming tasks, but it trails slightly costlier AMD and Intel CPUs in our benchmarks, making it a second-tier pick.",negative
15,"AMD's six-core Ryzen 5 5600 performs well enough for its price and is a solid midrange productivity and gaming CPU. Just mind the lack of integrated graphics and the street price of its own sterling sibling, the Ryzen 5 5600X.",positive
16,"AMD's premium-priced Ryzen 7 5800X3D is a solid eight-core performer, but its boosts to game pep and CPU-specific performance can't quite offset the cost bump.",negative
17,"With performance rivaling the Ryzen 7 5800X at a lower price, AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X is arguably the best value in the Ryzen 7 5000 series, but it can't quite stand up to Intel's new ""Alder Lake"" processors.",negative
18,"AMD's exceptionally fast Ryzen 7 5700G is a integrated-graphics-equipped, eight-core workhorse CPU of major proportions, slaying gaming records with its Radeon silicon alone.",positive
19,"Looking to play PC games without a graphics card? AMD's Ryzen 5 5600G CPU and its integrated graphics give cash-strapped gamers a superb, value-focused option that Intel can't match.",positive
